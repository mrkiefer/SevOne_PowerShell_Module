SevOne_PowerShell_Module
========================

Open repository for the SevOne SOAP API - working with SevOne v5.3.8a

At this point there is no stable release for the module, changes may break existing functionality at any point during the development cycle.
Please use this module with considerable caution while it is still under development. 

### This change added by David Kaye
### Introducing breaking change to Out-SevOneDeferredData 
#### Will remove this as soon as Out-DeferredData is working again
